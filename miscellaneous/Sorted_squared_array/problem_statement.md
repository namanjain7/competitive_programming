Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of integers that are sorted in ascending order and returns a new array of the same length with the squared of the original integers also sorted in ascending order.

Sample Input : [-3, -2, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output Array: [0, 1, 4, 4, 9, 9, 16, 25]

Optimal solution:
Time Complexity: O(N)
Space Complexity: O(N)
N - size of input array
